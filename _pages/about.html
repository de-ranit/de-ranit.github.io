I work on simulating gross primary production (GPP) at sub-daily scale using eddy-covariance data and light use efficiency-based models. My main focus is understanding the factors influencing interannual variability (IAV) in carbon fluxes and how their representations can be improved in biogeochemical models.</p> <p>Before starting my PhD, I earned a master‚Äôs degree in Geo-information Science and Earth Observation with a specialization in Water Resources and Environmental Management from <a href="https://www.itc.nl/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Faculty ITC</a> of University of Twente, Netherlands. During my master‚Äôs thesis, I worked with radiative transfer models to retrieve biophysical model parameters, simulate carbon fluxes, and estimate crop yield. I also had a Bachelor of Technology degree in Agricultural Engineering from Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences, India.</p> <p>Other than work, I am interested in exploring local landscapes ‚õ∞Ô∏è by trains üöÇ, and enjoying a nice home-cooked meal üç≤.</p> <h2>Research Interest</h2> <ul> <li>Global carbon cycle</li> <li>Simulating GPP flux</li> <li>Model-Data assimilation</li> </ul> </body></html>
