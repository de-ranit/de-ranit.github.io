I am a PhD researcher with <a href="https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/person/ncarval/5335138">Dr. Nuno Carvalhais</a> in <a href="https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/en/bgi/mdi">Model-Data Integration</a> group at <a href='https://www.bgc-jena.mpg.de/en'> Max Planck Institute for Biogeochemistry</a>. I work on simulating gross primary production (GPP) at sub-daily scale using eddy-covariance data and light use efficiency-based models. My main focus is understanding the factors influencing interannual variability (IAV) in carbon fluxes and how their representations can be improved in biogeochemical models.

Before starting my PhD, I earned a master's degree in Geo-information Science and Earth Observation with a specialization in Water Resources and Environmental Management from <a href="https://www.itc.nl/">Faculty ITC</a> of University of Twente, Netherlands. During my master's thesis, I worked with radiative transfer models to retrieve biophysical model parameters, simulate carbon fluxes, and estimate crop yield. I also had a Bachelor of Technology degree in Agricultural Engineering from Sam Higginbottom University of Agriculture, Technology and Sciences, India.

Other than work, I am interested in exploring local landscapes ‚õ∞Ô∏è by trains üöÇ, and enjoying a nice home-cooked meal üç≤.
